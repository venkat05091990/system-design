Target Groups

Target Groups are a group of machines , servers, scale units to where the Application Load Balancer routes the client requests.

Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create each listener rule, you specify a target group and conditions. 
When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group. You can create different target groups for different types of requests.
